# Smarties Challenge

## Specifications

Can you model an arrange of smarties in software?

* Our coach will want to eat one of your smarties, so please provide a way for them to 'eat' any one of the smarties that they choose. If they 'eat' a smartie it should no longer be counted, visible or eatable.
* They will want to ask how many smarties of a particular colour there are.
* Your code will be deployed. They will want to run your code on their computer, without you present, at some point in the future.

## Example

Clone repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:richardcrng/smarties-challenge.git
cd smarties-challenge
```

Install and then run locally:
```bash
npm install
npm run
```
